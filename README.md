# Play9-Game-React.js
Play 9 game implemented with html/CSS/React/JQuery. Did it as part of a PluralSight tutorial on React.js. Implemented using Plunker.

The idea of the game is for you to choose a single number or a combination of numbers to match the number of stars. You have to do five iterations of this to win, and you get chances to regenerate the number of stars in case you can't match their number.
